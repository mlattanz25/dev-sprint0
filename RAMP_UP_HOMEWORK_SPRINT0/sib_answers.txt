# Text answers from Week 0

# Name: Michael Lattanzio



Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
	
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()


Answer: TurtleWorld import is taking all the necessary files that need to be installed and using the terminal to run them.

The world = TurtleWorld() sets the Turtle equal to the program and whatever parameter might be place within the program.

wait_for_user() allows for the user to enter data to making the program interactive. 




These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

-- What are the arguments of polygon()?  What type is each argument?
Answer:

Arguments within a polygon are passed variables. length and angle are two examples of arguments. 


-- What two turtle functions did you use to draw the sides of the polygon?
Answer:

fd and lt


-- What are the arguments for polyline?  What type is each argument?
Answer:

arguments for polyline include length, and angle



Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.


-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?

Answer: def circle (t, r):
	circumference / n
	polygon (t, n, length)

	I would have to move the turtle along the diameter to the center of the circle.



-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer:

	I would have to use the lt function to make the proper amount of turns upon completion of its route.

-- What is this type of requirement called?
Answer:
